# AGARTHA
AGARTHA is a decentralized governance system designed to incorporate smart contracts connected to a system of voting and self-governance. The application is designed to be an autonomous system designed to decentralize power and create a better world through a collective system.

This is a foundational code structure and application interface for a self-governance application that exists outside of the current system. The application is designed to be ran in a decentralized manner where every participant has equal contribution and weighted vote. Smart contracts and block chain IDs linked to voting ensure transparency when engaging in the governmental system.
